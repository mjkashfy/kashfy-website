            During my first and second co-op, I spent 8 months developing 24/7 
            patient appointment chatbots and an employee appointment detection system,

            workflows using STAR scripting and automated processes to optimize 
            company applications. Additionally, I created training modules and 
            documentation to ensure a smooth transition for future co-op students and 
            seamless chatbot adoption after my term.</p>
